							<h1>Representational state transfer (REST)</h1>
							<p>Software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. </p>
							<p>Any web service that obeys the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST constraints</a> is informally described as RESTful.</p>

							<p><strong>Marshall Art Studio</strong> is my contractor identity. With the more logical domain names being unavailable (this was in the AOL era), I quickly chose one based on an old nickname.</p>
							<p>I'm an artist who's fumbled his way into enterprise level web development. By high school it was clear the only thing I was better at than anyone else around me was drawing pictures. This led me to going to Massachusetts College of Art for a BFA in commercial art (an antiquated name I still think is accurate).</p>

							<p>My struggling freelance illustration and comic book career got redirected to graphic design when Boston Phoenix design director and <a href="http://joelbenjaminphoto.blogspot.com/2012/12/debbies-barbies-in-news-again.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Debbie's Barbies: 2012 photo exhibit by Joel Benjamin of Debbie Klein's Barbie dolls">Barbie enthusiast</a> Debbie Klein told me, "Nobody needs an illustrator, but everyone needs designers."</p>
							<p>That 100% correct advice should be on a coffee mug. While working for the Phoenix, my skill at making great-looking ads for escort services and strip clubs increased exponentially. </p>
							<p>This began my 1990s push to corporate work. Career highlights include working for Gregory Fossella Associates, Midnight Oil Studios, Hill Holiday, Ingalls Quinn &amp; Johnson, JWG Associates, WFNX, International Data Corporation, MacGraw-Hill, and Houghton Mifflin. <a href="../blog/rip-employers.htm" aria-label="former clients and employers resting in peace">Some of those companies</a> are still around.  </p>
							<p>That print experience transitioned to web design, which led to the last two decades of corporate web development. The code base evolved from its infancy of Adobe PageMill, embedded styles, and font tags to its current adolescence of CSS preprocessors, responsive grid systems, and javascript frameworks. I occasionally crack open my OS9 Powerbook G3 just to see how far we've come. But that's a blog for another day.</p>
							<p>Where would I be now without Debbie's well timed advice? Probably accosting Newbury Street tourists with, "Psst! I did a full page ad for Foxy Lady in 1988. Gimme a buck!" Not bad for a poor kid from Springfield. The best is yet to come.</p>
							<p>I'm a Capricorn who earned his BFA from Massachusetts College of Art in 1986.</p>
